      <div><p>After a week of looking around, some of what I already thought was the way to go remained and some has changed. The elements are still the same, Need to get a certification that is recognized in the market, but have to keep in mind my limited budget for the year. Have to get a methodology in place and start the process of hunting for bugs and finally, what to do with the platforms of study I was already doing.</p>
<p>Sometime, not too long ago, I would argue that fixing goals and/or what to go for like that would be a mistake. There is a flow to learning, specially in huge fields like information security. New findings in specific things can lead to a new world of discoveries, a new world of knowledge that grabs your attention harder than anything else, and ignoring them tends to make you miserable doing you&rsquo;re not so exciting chores.</p>
<p>But there is always going to be a need for a solid base.</p>
<blockquote>

You don’t set out to build a wall. You don&rsquo;t say ‘I’m going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that’s ever been built.’ You don’t start there. You say, ‘I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.’ You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall.<br>
&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The certification I chose to go for is eJPT, it&rsquo;s cheap first of all, it&rsquo;s easy and it is recognized. I believe there will be some burnout for having to study stuff I am tired of. It&rsquo;s not going to kill me tho, going back and having a second look. The goal is 3 months to get it, that is more than enough. I can focus on a harder, more valuable cert in the winter.
I also chose PEH as a course with a certification without exam that seem to be very well reviewed by the community. It&rsquo;s not that expensive, has some active directory stuff on it which to me is very important.</p>
<p>Those two are necessary. I will power through them, even if they are boring. I will have reached the goal by Jun 21.</p>
<p>On the bug hunting side of things, Jhaddix is the way I decided to go. Before the first day, I will watch and rewatch all four bug hunters methodology as much as I can. I will take from it as much as I can. Joplin notes are ready for it.
Trying to create a methodology theoretically doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I will have a baseline of steps to go through and polish them as I go. The bug hunting objective remains the same, 1 paid bug. 10 dollars would be enough. This is a blind jump into this world basically. Actual experience with web application bugs for me is only on SQL injections. Time to become a XSS ninja, a CSRF ninja. Can&rsquo;t wait for it.</p>
<p>And at last but not least, the classic thm -&gt; htb -&gt; vulnhub path is what I choose to keep practicing. Get that top 100 on thm, do all the easy ones on htb seems like a reasonable goal. Maybe not for the three months because of everything else but the train keeps on rolling for the year.</p>
<p>This post settles it. Those are the goals. I should not deviate from the path, and will get back to reevaluate it in June.<br>
Let&rsquo;s get it.</p>
