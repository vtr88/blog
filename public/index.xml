      <description>After a week of looking around, some of what I already thought was the way to go remained and some has changed. The elements are still the same, Need to get a certification that is recognized in the market, but have to keep in mind my limited budget for the year. Have to get a methodology in place and start the process of hunting for bugs and finally, what to do with the platforms of study I was already doing.</description>

      <description>2022 should be a year in which I complete my pivot from full stack enterprise developer to the information security field. Be it as a bug bounty hunter, be it as pentester, at this point I would even go in as a blue teamer just so I can get my foot off the doorsteps.
My experience as a developer proved useless when trying to break the HR barrier, as expected. And the lack of working experience and certifications does not help.</description>
