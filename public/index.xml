      <description>There is a part of me that does not care at all. There is a nihilism at the core of my being, that does not get hurt when dealing with hurtful things. It does not get excited with ego boosts from whatever the source. It really does not care. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t move.
It has seen it all. It comprehends. It might not know the real reason, but the guesses are never be far off.</description>

      <description>Was progress made? Yes.
I almost feel embarrassed for posting that python script on the last post. Had to do five other ones. Most of them are handling results from a tool and sending it to the next one. Some of them are just organizing the results in a easier to examine format. Along the way I missed the fact that I need to httpx the results, find valid 200 URLs to test for the OWASP top 10.</description>

      <description>Was needed.
First week is not over yet, but it was not a good one. There were technical issues while trying to brute force subdomains for the xxx.playstation.net with amass. Yes, I chose playstation as one of the targets by the way. The notebook that is being used on the tests almost died while doing it. Then after cancelling the process (but still getting 500+ domains), masscan took a day to finish.</description>

      <description>Or the post that should have the strategy but actually became a post about the strategy to build a strategy.
My methodology for bug hunting, I decided, was going to follow Jason Haddix videos and zseano&amp;rsquo;s guide. The latest interaction of Haddix&amp;rsquo;s does not touch on the application analysis part, only on the recon side and that alone was overwhelming. I initially thought I could pick a tool for every step of the way, quickly wire it together with a python script and generate something to feed a joplin notebook.</description>

      <description>After a week of looking around, some of what I already thought was the way to go remained and some has changed. The elements are still the same, Need to get a certification that is recognized in the market, but have to keep in mind my limited budget for the year. Have to get a methodology in place and start the process of hunting for bugs and finally, what to do with the platforms of study I was already doing.</description>

      <description>2022 should be a year in which I complete my pivot from full stack enterprise developer to the information security field. Be it as a bug bounty hunter, be it as pentester, at this point I would even go in as a blue teamer just so I can get my foot off the doorsteps.
My experience as a developer proved useless when trying to break the HR barrier, as expected. And the lack of working experience and certifications does not help.</description>
