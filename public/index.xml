      <description>2022 should be a year in which I complete my pivot from full stack enterprise developer to the information security field. Be it as a bug bounty hunter, be it as pentester, at this point I would even go in as a blue teamer just so I can get my foot off the doorsteps.
My experience as a developer proved useless when trying to break the HR barrier, as expected. And the lack of working experience and certifications does not help.</description>
