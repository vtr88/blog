Was progress made? Yes.  
I almost feel embarrassed for posting that python script on the last post. Had to do five other ones. Most of them are handling results from a tool and sending it to the next one. Some of them are just organizing the results in a easier to examine format.
Along the way I missed the fact that I need to httpx the results, find valid 200 URLs to test for the OWASP top 10. Found some things. Maybe I just think I found things. For now, that is progress. That is evolution. Slower than predicted (as always), but evolution nonetheless.  

And with that said, I need to stop, as life happens, and point out how relationships can be of help, how they can be an issue and how, more importantly, it's all about you.  

The concept is simple, you keep trying to balance relationships with the work you need to do, with studies, with daily stuff. I can only speak for me, and for me, it was always a problem. Not onyl my partner, but friends. Where I am looking to get requires hard dedication, and obviously, no one cares. They should'nt, is what I learned. The situation where I have time to work what I need to work, what I need to write and do, can only be constructed by me, independent of what they want. But the revelation was, my friends won't follow. I need to be able to say no, I need to be able to move on, if necessary.  
My love always do, tho. I feel proud, she followed me into the depths of alcohol abuse, when I think about it, not that it was not supposed to be a problem for her eventually anyway, but I am part of her issue with it. It was highly damaging, for both of us. But she was there. She is almost always there. I feel blessed.   

Today, a sunday, we started off losing a championship in a sad way (talking about the football team we both root for, we are brazilians after all), then we drank, excessively. But I decided to change the direction of the night. For me. That is a very important point.  

Only for me.  

And she followed. Because she does see the good in it. Because she also have stuff to do, and want a cool and fun place to do it. She wants to do it with me. She loves me. I love her. This is the start of the night, this post, I have a lot to go for now, and I will. Couldn't be happier, learning as I go. This will be a night to remember. All nights should be a night to remember when I am with the love of my life.
