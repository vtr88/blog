After a week of looking around, some of what I already thought was the way to go remained and some has changed. The elements are still the same, Need to get a certification that is recognized in the market, but have to keep in mind my limited budget for the year. Have to get a methodology in place and start the process of hunting for bugs and finally, what to do with the platforms of study I was already doing.  

Sometime, not too long ago, I would argue that fixing goals and/or what to go for like that would be a mistake. There is a flow to learning, specially in huge fields like information security. New findings in specific things can lead to a new world of discoveries, a new world of knowledge that grabs your attention harder than anything else, and ignoring them tends to make you miserable doing you're not so exciting chores.  

But there is always going to be a need for a solid base.

The certification I chose to go for is eJPT, it's cheap first of all, it's easy and it is recognized. I believe there will be some burnout for having to study stuff I am tired of. It's not going to kill me tho, going back and having a second look. The goal is 3 months to get it, that is more than enough. I can focus on a harder, more valuable cert in the winter.
I also chose PEH as a course with a certification without exam that seem to be very well reviewed by the community. It's not that expensive, has some active directory stuff on it which to me is very important.  

Those two are necessary. I will power through them, even if they are boring. I will have reached the goal by Jun 21.  

On the bug hunting side of things, Jhaddix is the way I decided to go. Before the first day, I will watch and rewatch all four bug hunters methodology as much as I can. I will take from it as much as I can. Joplin notes are ready for it.
Trying to create a methodology theoretically doesn't make sense to me. I will have a baseline of steps to go through and polish them as I go. The bug hunting objective remains the same, 1 paid bug. 10 dollars would be enough. This is a blind jump into this world basically. Actual experience with web application bugs for me is only on SQL injections. Time to become a XSS ninja, a CSRF ninja. Can't wait for it.  

And at last but not least, the classic thm -> htb -> vulnhub path is what I choose to keep practicing. Get that top 100 on thm, do all the easy ones on htb seems like a reasonable goal. Maybe not for the three months because of everything else but the train keeps on rolling for the year.  

This post settles it. Those are the goals. I should not deviate from the path, and will get back to reevaluate it in June.  
Let's get it.
