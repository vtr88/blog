There is a part of me that does not care at all. There is a nihilism at the core of my being, that does not get hurt when dealing with hurtful things. It does not get excited with ego boosts from whatever the source. It really does not care. It doesn't move.

It has seen it all. It comprehends. It might not know the real reason, but the guesses are never be far off.  

It is the thing I mostly run from all the time. While at it's dominance, there is no progress. There are no tasks.
It goes only in the direction of instantaneous pleasure, be it whatever it is, at the cost of everything, if needed.  
It's a paralyzing state of slow and progressive decadence. Slowly rotting. Broken.  

Got to make myself believe again. It should be far from over.
